<h1>Lab01: JavaScript Exercises</h1>

<p>This file has a bunch of <code>inline</code> JavaScript that you can't see. It's <em>ghost code</em>. OooOoooOOooh...</p>

<p>Right-click and "view source" to see the code.</p>

<p>Open your <code>JavaScript Console</code> through the developer tools and you'll see the output of a print statement.</p>

<h4>Prelude</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Accept this repo invite: https://classroom.github.com/a/9O_5Hg6g</li>
	<li>Using your source control tool of choice <code>clone</code> the empty repo</li>
	<li>Create a subfolder in the repo called <code>lab01</code></li>
	<li>Right-click and save this file into that <code>lab01</code> folder. <strong>Make sure you save HTML only, not Webpage Complete on Windows!</strong></li>
	<li><code>commit</code> and <code>push</code> your changes. Verify them in the GitHub web interface.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Work, work</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Open the local html file in your browser and editor</li>
	<li>Edit the inline JavaScript as indicated, and verify the output in the console</li>
	<li><code>commit</code> and <code>push</code> your changes.</li>
</ol>

// JavaScript is interpreted top to bottom, so any code in this file will be run 
// as soon as it's loaded into a browser. Functions can be defined along the way as well.

console.log("This is how you print to the console!");

// The JavaScript console doesn't support user input - we'll be working with content on
// web pages. For these exercises, we'll just assign hardcoded values to variables. Note
// the point is that the code must work with any values you choose!


// Q1: Declare two variables and set them to floating-point values.
//     Display (on the console) the product of the two variables.



// Q2: Declare four variables and set them to floating-point values.
//     Calculate the average of those variables and display it.



// Q3: Declare two variables and set them to string values.
//     If the two strings are the same, display "Equal".
//     If the two strings are not the same, display "Not Equal".



// Q4: Declare a variable and set it to an integer value.
//     Determine whether the variable is even or odd, and display "Even" or "Odd".



// Q5: Write a function that takes two variables and returns the value of the larger one.
//     Using that function and the four variables from Q2, display the value of the largest one.



// Q6: Declare an array of five integer values.
//     Using a loop, calculate and display their sum and average.



// Q7: Write a function that takes an integer N and uses a loop to display all the positive 
//     integers up to N.
//     Call that function with the value 8 to display "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8".
//     (note! do it on one line using string concatenation)



// Q8: Using nested loops, and the variable from Q4, display that many rows of numbers.
//     The first row should have 1, the second row should have 1 2, third row should have 1 2 3
//     and so on.
// e.g. Input: 4
// Display: 1
//          1 2
//          1 2 3
//          1 2 3 4



// Q9: Using the array forEach method, display the numbers in the array from Q6.



// Q10: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the smallest value.
//      Call that function with the array from Q6 and display the returned value.



// Q11: Declare an associative array with three names as keys and ages as values.
//      Display all the key/value pairs like: "Jose is 17".
